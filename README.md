## Predict Sales

## Overview

This project focuses on building a predictive model to forecast sales based on historical data and relevant features.

## Objectives

- Analyze sales data and identify key patterns
- Prepare and engineer features for modeling
- Build and train predictive models
- Evaluate model performance
- Make sales predictions

## Dataset

sales - sales.csv

## Technologies

- Python
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib/Seaborn

# Bashar info

New Challenge: Mini Project "IronKaggle"
Get ready to channel your inner Data Scientist! We are officially kicking off the IronKaggle mini-project.

The Goal: Build a model to predict sales based on the training data provided. You’ll need to explore
the dataset and perform feature engineering to get the best possible results.

The Timeline:
Training Data: Access the Google Sheet here

The Final Test: On Saturday, we will release REAL_DATA.csv. This is the "blind" data where we will see how your models actually perform!

Your Mission: Download the training data.Perform your EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis).Train and refine your models.Be ready for the "Leaderboard" reveal on Saturday!Good luck, and let the best model win!
